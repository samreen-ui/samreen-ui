### Full-Stack Mobile Developer | AI enthusiast 

I am a B.Tech student with a strong foundation in full-stack mobile development, artificial intelligence, and cloud-based systems. My technical expertise spans Flutter, React Native, Firebase, Supabase, MongoDB, Firestore, and SQL databases. I have implemented and deployed deep learning models such as Inception V3 and VGG16, and machine learning algorithms including Decision Trees and Random Forests (for both classification and regression).

I have built and deployed scalable solutions that integrate LLMs (Gemini API), Flask-based APIs, real-time satellite data from Google Earth Engine. My focus is on creating intelligent, real-time applications that are both impactful and production-ready.
